# Calorie-Counter
Find your recommended daily caloric intake amount. Store your intake data. Receive visual data on your daily intake.

This program is a user friendly tool that allows you to easily calculate your recommended daily caloric intake based on your individual needs.
After your recommended intake is calculated, your individual account is stored with an encrypted password. Then you can store
your daily calories consumed with a very user-friendly graph. Once your consumed foods are inputted, you will be given your total
calories consumed and a percentage that is your calories consumed to recommended needs ratio. Then you will be guided to a great
line chart that serves as a visual aid for your daily caloric intake. You can also view your monthly calendar with information on
your tracked calories and percentages.
